25	25	Highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles . <EOS>	1
26	26	It seems to me that all good apps / games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts and waiting to be featured just is not worth it . <EOS>	1
27	27	Maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it . <EOS>	1
28	28	It would be great to be able to use the WP <NUMBER> emulator ( and Surface emulator for that matter ) for mobility demonstrations i . e . when I deliver a Dynamics CRM demo I often ( nearly always ) want to include mobility scenarios on the same screen as the rest of the demo . <EOS>	1

47	47	why should not I as user be able to see reviews made by people from other countries ? <EOS>	1
48	48	For apps that synchronize or connect to networks sporadically it would be handy to have an easy way to detect if you are on a cheap connection so if WiFi is connected or the device is connected to the web via USB . <EOS>	1
49	49	"So suggestion is to add properties like "" IsWiFiConnected "" and "" IsCableConnected "" to DeviceNetworkInformation that execute fast . <EOS>"	1

60	60	Since windows phones are selling hot in countries like India browser should start displaying Indian language characters . <EOS>	1

97	97	If our - ISV - UWP App also have this feature we can spent more time to trying the new feature and Insider customer and testers can use it and we could got feedbacks . <EOS>	0
98	98	Because if you currently assign a Binding a VisualState setter as below it will resolve the value of the binding and assign that to the target while you would like to assign the binding itself . <EOS>	0
99	99	This will allow designs and implementations to change bindings depending on states and even help some states where some bindings are not required to be temporarily set to x : Null for performance ( handy in complex screens ) . <EOS>	0

238	238	As I understand it insider reviews that are not on the slow ring are removed even worse they are deleted permanently from even the Developer Dashboard . <EOS>	0

241	241	I have had over fifty <NUMBER> \+ star reviews simply disappear never to be seen again . <EOS>	0
242	242	I see the point that insiders should not bring down the ratings of the app if the OS is to blame . but with so few people rating anyway and most people being on the fast insider ring it makes it extremely hard to get reviews . <EOS>	0
243	243	Old Windows Phone 8 . 1 retain their status of being the most highly rated just because of this . <EOS>	0
244	244	What 's the point of having a rule if that means there 's too few reviews and no point for most people to post reviews at all ? <EOS>	0
245	245	I am not quite sure what a good solution is you cold allow only <NUMBER> \+ reviews for fast insiders but I guess that might skew reviews too positively . <EOS>	0
246	246	Or why not let the text review stand even if the rating does not count ? <EOS>	0

254	254	In this case the SplitViewPane gets closed as expected but it does that by seemingly overwriting the Binding on IsPaneOpen and instead setting it directly to the value false . <EOS>	0
255	255	The effect is that the panel can never be opened again as my code will do this by setting the VM property to true but the binding was already lost . <EOS>	0

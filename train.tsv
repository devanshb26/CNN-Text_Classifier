If this change was made it would be easier to target a UI to low resolution / low end devices by being able to set the pane to top or bottom for the apps menu controls instead of having to rig together a solution of setting the visibility of an external control and turning off a bunch of settings on the pane when screen resolution gets narrow enough .
